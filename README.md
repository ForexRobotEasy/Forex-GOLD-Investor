Forex GOLD Investor is an automated trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It implements a combination of scalping and time-based trading strategies, along with intelligent money management techniques, to maximize profits in the gold market.

## Scalping Trading Strategy
The scalping strategy is designed to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations in the gold market. It defines an entry criteria based on the current market price and sets a stop-loss and take-profit level for risk management. The lot size is calculated based on the account balance and risk preferences.

```cpp
void ScalpingStrategy() {
    // Define entry criteria for scalping strategy
    double entryPrice = GetEntryPrice(); // Function to get the entry price
    double stopLoss = entryPrice - 10; // Set stop-loss level
    double takeProfit = entryPrice + 10; // Set take-profit level

    // Calculate lot size based on account balance and risk preferences
    double accountBalance = GetAccountBalance(); // Function to get account balance
    double riskPercentage = 0.02; // Set risk percentage
    double lotSize = accountBalance * riskPercentage / 100;

    // Open trade
    OpenTrade(entryPrice, lotSize, stopLoss, takeProfit); // Function to open trade
}
```

## Time-based Trading Strategy
The time-based strategy is implemented to trade within defined time intervals. It checks if the current hour is within the specified opening and closing hours and opens a trade accordingly. The lot size is calculated based on the account balance and risk preferences.

```cpp
void TimeBasedStrategy() {
    // Define time intervals for opening and closing trades
    int openHour = 9; // Set opening hour
    int closeHour = 16; // Set closing hour

    // Check if current time is within the defined time interval
    int currentHour = GetCurrentHour(); // Function to get current hour
    if (currentHour >= openHour && currentHour <= closeHour) {
        // Calculate lot size based on account balance and risk preferences
        double accountBalance = GetAccountBalance(); // Function to get account balance
        double riskPercentage = 0.03; // Set risk percentage
        double lotSize = accountBalance * riskPercentage / 100;

        // Open trade
        OpenTrade(GetEntryPrice(), lotSize, GetStopLoss(), GetTakeProfit()); // Function to open trade
    }
}
```

## Intelligent Money Management
The intelligent money management technique calculates the optimal lot size based on the account balance and risk preferences. It compares the current lot size with the optimal lot size and adjusts the lot size accordingly to optimize profits.

```cpp
void IntelligentMoneyManagement() {
    // Calculate optimal lot size based on account balance and risk preferences
    double accountBalance = GetAccountBalance(); // Function to get account balance
    double riskPercentage = 0.05; // Set risk percentage
    double optimalLotSize = accountBalance * riskPercentage / 100;

    // Check if current lot size is less than the optimal lot size
    double currentLotSize = GetCurrentLotSize(); // Function to get current lot size
    if (currentLotSize < optimalLotSize) {
        // Increase lot size
        IncreaseLotSize(optimalLotSize - currentLotSize); // Function to increase lot size
    } else if (currentLotSize > optimalLotSize) {
        // Decrease lot size
        DecreaseLotSize(currentLotSize - optimalLotSize); // Function to decrease lot size
    }
}
```

## Main Function
The main function, `OnTick()`, executes the scalping strategy, time-based strategy, and intelligent money management techniques. It is called on each tick of the market to analyze and execute trades.

```cpp
void OnTick() {
    // Execute scalping strategy
    ScalpingStrategy();

    // Execute time-based strategy
    TimeBasedStrategy();

    // Execute intelligent money management
    IntelligentMoneyManagement();
}
```
